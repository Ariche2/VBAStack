All tables are formatted as follows,

The following are the work of Alex Ionescu, with some of my own notes sprinkled in;


    Project information
    Symbol name; Unknown to me
    RE Community name; Unknown to me
    Size; 0x23C bytes.
    The Project Information structure is pointed by the VB Header. It contains user information about the project as well as critical information (such as a pointer to the Object Table). It is also heavily used for compilation statistics.

    0x0;dwVersion;5.00 in Hex (0x1F4). Version.
    0x4;lpObjectTable;Pointer to the Object Table
    0x8;dwNull;Unused value after compilation.
    0xC;lpCodeStart;Points to start of code. Unused.
    0x10;lpCodeEnd;Points to end of code. Unused.
    0x14;dwDataSize;Size of VB Object Structures. Unused.
    0x18;lpThreadSpace;Pointer to Pointer to Thread Object.

    0x238;dwExternalCount;Objects in the External Table.


    Secondary project information
    Symbol name; Unknown to me
    RE Community name; Unknown to me
    Size; 0x28 bytes.
    This Secondary structure, pointed by the Object Table contains mostly data used when compiling the project. It does also however pave the way to the Form List (To be described later) and gives the elusive Help Context ID.

    0x0;lpHeapLink;Unused after compilation, always 0.
    0x4;lpObjectTable;Back-Pointer to the Object Table.
    0x8;dwReserved;Always set to -1 after compiling. Unused
    0xC;dwUnused;Not written or read in any case.
    0x10;lpObjectList;Pointer to Object Descriptor Pointers.
    0x14;dwUnused2;Not written or read in any case.
    0x18;szProjectDescription;Pointer to Project Description
    0x1C;szProjectHelpFile;Pointer to Project Help File
    0x20;dwReserved2;Always set to -1 after compiling. Unused
    0x24;dwHelpContextId;Help Context ID set in Project Settings.


    Object Table
    Symbol name; Unknown to me
    RE Community name; Unknown to me
    Size; 0x54 bytes.
    The Object Table structure is pointed by the Project Info Structure. It contains points to the Object Array, as well as more repeated Project Data (presumably so it can be read quickly from here). Some values are also only used when running the project in memory (in the IDE).

    0x0;lpHeapLink;Unused after compilation, always 0.
    0x4;lpExecProj;Pointer to VB Project Exec COM Object. <- Alex seemed to know what ExecProj was, but it isn't in here?
    0x8;lpProjectInfo2;Secondary Project Information.
    0xC;dwReserved;Always set to -1 after compiling. Unused
    0x10;dwNull;Not used in compiled mode.
    0x14;lpProjectObject;Pointer to in-memory Project Data.
    0x18;uuidObject;GUID of the Object Table.
    0x28;fCompileState;Internal flag used during compilation.
    0x2A;dwTotalObjects;Total objects present in Project.

    0x50;dwIdentifier;Template Version of Structure.


    Private Object Descriptor
    Symbol name; Unknown to me
    RE Community name; Unknown to me
    Size; 0x40 bytes.
    The Private Object Descriptor Table is pointed by an array defined in the Object List Pointer in the Secondary Project Information. The whole structure can be deleted after compilation.

    0x4;dwReserved;Always set to -1 after compiling.
    0x8;lpPublicBytes;Pointer to Public Variable Size integers.
